Procedure is often used to refer to some parameterized chunk of code that may have side effects.

An expression e is referentially transparent if, for all programs p, all occurrences of e in p can be replaced by the result of evaluating e without affecting the meaning of p.
A function f is pure if the expression f(x) is referentially transparent for all referentially transparent x.
